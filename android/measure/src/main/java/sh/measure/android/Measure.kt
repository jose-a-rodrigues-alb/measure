     * along with Activity and Fragment lifecycle events. But if your app uses a custom navigation
     * system, you can use this method to track navigation events to have more context when
     * debugging issues.
     *
     * For more details on the automatically collected events, check the documentation.
     *
     * It is recommended to use consistent naming conventions for screen names and namespacing
     * them with relevant context to make it easier to understand the user journey on the Measure
     * Dashboard.
     *
     * Example usage:
     *
     * ```kotlin
     * Measure.trackNavigation("Home", "Login")
     * ```
     *
     * @param to The name of the destination screen or location.
